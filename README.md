vim-dots
========

Vim-♥'ers dotfiles and scripts. (for [`...`](http://github.com/ingydotnet/....git).)

Contains some `.vim/` boosters.

Makes zsh be vi-keys, with a few spiffups.

Shell Stuff
-----------

* `vat` → Like `cat` but use vim.
* `vack` → Run `ack` through vim (if called without args, use previous line's args)
